Looking for an stock prediction algorithm that can predict the candlestick pattern at that point in time with 80 - 90% accuracy.

Key aspects of the model:
- Consideration of the macro and micro trends that impact the stock price(industry, company news)
- Need to scan global stock market rather than just US
- Output the top list of stocks that have a candlestick price range with 10 - 20% difference between high and low with highest confidence
- Production ready code and setup that is running on a cloud environment on a frequent schedule within a day to support intra day trading
- Ability to run ad-hoc to get the latest prediction

Please reach out only if you are confident enough on building the model with high accuracy.
